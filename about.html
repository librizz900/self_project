            <p>On the surface, i think i am like most young and a modern guy. I have dreams and goals for the future and i am determined to make it happenand i will work hard to achieve these goals.
                 What amkes me special is perhaps my family background.I come from a very conservative and religios family who has some old fashioned set of ideas about how human should behave in the society so it was not an easy task for me to have 'modern' goals and dreams of getting a proper education to reach success</p>

            <p>
                At first, it never occured to me that persuading my family to let me continue my education was  my first achievement
                It was dawn on me on one saturday morning when i saw my family already gathered dicussing and just waiting for me to get the conclusion.
                 when i was seated,
                 a cool loving voice of my sweet mother ran with the speed of liht into my left ear saying <i class="about_italics"> "Tola my love, we know you are a very intelligent boy but at this point after training your brother and sister in the university, 
                    we thought the best for you is to leran a hand work and not to go to school because currently i and your father are retired and have not even started collecting our pension yet". </i>
                     I was left devastated immediately but i heard another sound whispering to my right ear saying <span class="about_span"> "Oboy dont worry, you gonna rugged this through and make somthing out of nothing"</span>. I calle a family meeting with a bold mind and i told them to please help me gather money for the acceptance fee because at that time i wasnt working.

            </p>
            <p>i entered school bouncing and happy but with a part of me which kept reminding me of the greater and tudios task ahead.I started by making a like mind a friend and a school mother, 
                we bother find past questions and materials together with the minset that we may have to mis many classes due to the fact that unlike other student who get their income pumping in fom their parents, we would get ours from our hard earned part-time jobs.</p>
            <p>To cut the long story short, we both gradruated the due year and went to serve the country in different states.</p>
            <P>This determination i have shown so far will only grow stronger as i grow older .
                 Now i want to follow a career in web development not just becaus i already have the background knowledge of what it entails but also i want to make the hell of  a huge fucking money out ofthe industry in other to completely fufil my dreams.</P>
